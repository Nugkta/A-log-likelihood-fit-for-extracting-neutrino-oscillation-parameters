General comments about running the code:

To see most of the results demonstrate in the report, just directly run the whole file in any IDE. Plots will be produced 
and numerical results will be printed in the console.


If you want to use the sections to produce the some of the more delicate results separately, such as timing the
functions or interacting with the plots, I recommand to use Spyder as the IDE. And you need to use shift + enter to
run section by section. 

Unquote %%time and run to time the cell

For the interactive plots, including the 4D visualisation, the setting needs to be modified: 
Tools --- Preferences --- IPython console --- Graphic --- Graphics backend --- set to Automatic
